Here is supplementary program and dataset for the manuscript "Modeling Nonstationary Extremal Dependence via Deep Spatial Deformations".


Folders and documents in Scripts&Codes:
1. AppData: application data and modelling results
2. SimData: simulated data and modelling results
3. Functions: functions for modelling that will be introduced in application_UKpr.R and simulation_Archi3.R
4. application_UKpr.R: the script for data application with UK precipitation data
5. simulation_Archi3.R: the script for a simulation demo, which will generate a simulation data


Remarks: Current program only works for Tensorflow version 2.11.0 and Python version 3.7.11. Implementing scripts require installation of Python language, Tensorflow, and tensorFlow packages in R.


How to Start:
1. Install corresponding softwares and packages.
2. Implement simulation_Archi3.R or application_UKpr.R for the simulation demo or the data application.
